<p>
  I am a certified software developer with over 3 years of experience
  working in the tech industry, providing valuable expertise
  to start-up businesses and collaborating with other developers.
  I have worked on various types of projects and have been
  using multiple programming languages, such as
  <strong>Java</strong> with <strong>Spring boot</strong>,
  <strong>Python</strong> with <strong>Flask, JavaScript, C#</strong>.
  But actually I've been more focused on 2 main technologies, which are
  <strong>Java/Spring boot</strong> for backend and
  <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> for frontend.


  In July 2019, I started working as a freelancer,
  and here I do front end and backend work using multiple programming
  languages. At the end of 2020, a friend invited me to collaborate with
  him in a startup called <strong>Collabo Branding Agency</strong>,
  and I'm working with them as of right now. Every month we develop at
  least 5 websites using multiples technologies, sometimes ReactJS, Java,
  WordPress, Shopify etc.
